# Game Mechanics: Leveling Up and Rewards

## Introduction

Our app offers a dynamic and immersive experience through a level-up system that keeps users engaged as they explore the Northern Territory. The more they explore, complete challenges, and capture photos, the more they level up—unlocking new benefits and rewards that enhance their adventure. This gamified mechanic is central to the app's goal of creating continuous, exciting engagement.

## How It Works

Players level up by completing tasks, such as visiting designated checkpoints, taking accurate photos at these locations, and discovering hidden checkpoints. The system is designed to motivate users to explore more of the Northern Territory, rewarding their efforts with both in-app benefits and real-world perks.

## Level-Up Requirements

To move up in levels, players must meet specific criteria. The following requirements define the progression through the levels:

### Completion of Challenges

Players must successfully complete a set number of challenges at each level, which could include visiting pin-point locations, capturing accurate photos, and finding hidden checkpoints.

### Points Accumulation

Each task or checkpoint visit rewards players with points. The total points required to level up increase with each stage, encouraging deeper exploration.

### Bonus for Hidden Checkpoints

Players who find and unlock hidden checkpoints gain bonus points, giving them an advantage in leveling up faster.

### Distance Travelled

The app tracks how far users have traveled to reach various checkpoints. Greater distances covered can contribute to level progression, further incentivizing users to explore more remote and less-traveled parts of the NT.

## Level Benefits

As players level up, they unlock increasingly valuable rewards and benefits, motivating them to continue exploring and engaging with the game. These benefits include:

### Increased Rewards

Higher levels unlock more significant rewards, such as Aboriginal handcraft, NT-only souvenirs, and discounts at local businesses, and more.

### Bonus Challenges

### Enhanced In-App Features

Levelling up also unlocks new in-app features, such as enhanced AR navigation tools, building up their AR camp in NT plus captured VR animals to get contributed points.

### Leaderboard Placement

Players who reach higher levels can appear on regional leaderboards, showcasing their achievements and allowing them to compete with others for top positions. Being featured on the leaderboard provides social recognition and motivates further engagement.

### Exclusive Yearly Voting Privileges

High-level players can participate in the annual gallery with greater influence, as their votes count more toward determining the top gallery submission. This not only keeps them engaged but also connects them to the app's community in a meaningful way.

## Continuous Engagement

The combination of level progression and meaningful rewards ensures that users remain engaged long after they’ve started exploring. As they move up the levels, they’re driven to discover new places, take on more challenging tasks, and share their experiences with friends—ultimately fueling the app's goal of spreading awareness and excitement about NT tourism.
